  <h1>How to Play Battleship</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Before the game begins, each player can place their 5 ships on their grid.
      The other player will not know where your ships are being placed, and vice versa.
    </li>
    <li>
      Both players have the same ships and are listed along with their sizes:
      <ol>
        <li>Carrier (5)</li>
        <li>Battleship (4)</li>
        <li>Destroyer (3)</li>
        <li>Submarine (3)</li>
        <li>Patrol Boat (2)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      When placing ships, keep in mind their size as that is how many grid squares they
      will take up. Also, ships cannot overlap on your grid.
    </li>
    <li>Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.</li>
    <li>Once each player has their ships set, the game can begin.</li>
    <li>
      During each turn, the player can send a torpedo to a grid square in hope of landing
      a shot on the hidden enemy ship. If a ship is hit, the player can continue to send
      torpedos. If the shot is missed, then the turn ends.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are 2 super powers that players can use:
      <ul>
        <li>Send 3 torpedos in one turn (instead of just 1)</li>
        <li>Send a big torpedo that will hit 5 grid squares (in the shape of a +)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A super power can only be used if a player only has at most 2 ships remaining.</li>
    <li>Only one super power can be used by each player in a game.</li>
    <li>Once a player's ships have been completely sunk, the game ends.</li>
  </ul>
